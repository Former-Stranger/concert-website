# Session Handoff - October 30, 2025

## Session Overview
This session focused on completing a massive setlist import (812 new setlists), implementing an update setlist feature, fixing UI issues, and cleaning up duplicate data.

---

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. ✅ Automated Setlist Fetching with API Key Rotation (COMPLETE)

**Achievement**: Successfully fetched **812 new setlists** from setlist.fm API

**Created**: `scripts/fetch_missing_setlists_with_rotation.py`
- Automatic rotation between 3 API keys when rate limits are hit
- Stops gracefully after 15 consecutive rate limit errors per key
- Progress tracking every 10 concerts
- Used only Key #1 (no rate limits encountered!)

**Results**:
- Processed: 1,119 concerts without setlists
- Successfully imported: 812 setlists (72.6% success rate)
- Not found on setlist.fm: 305 concerts
- Errors: 0
- Skipped: 2 (missing dates)

**Coverage Improvement**:
- **Before**: 542 concerts with setlists (42.6%)
- **After**: 986 concerts with setlists (77.3%)
- **Gain**: +444 concerts with complete setlists
- **Songs added**: 2,343 new songs (from ~5,562 to 7,905 total)

**API Keys Used**:
1. `DrR0j3jlKSLRrXSTsd_r71QUIA24ZQydjpsE` (Key #1) - Used for all 1,117 requests
2. `Uo48MPdBZN5ujA_PJKkyeKYyiMzOaf-kd4gi` (Key #2) - Not needed
3. `_Q380wqoYXFLsXALU_vlNSUTjwy7j7KQ6Bx9` (Key #3) - Not needed

---

### 2. ✅ Fixed Duplicate GitHub Actions Workflow (COMPLETE)

**Problem**: Two workflows triggering simultaneously on setlist submissions

**Root Cause**:
- `deploy-on-setlist-update.yml` listening for `deploy-setlist` event
- `deploy.yml` ALSO listening for `deploy-setlist` event
- Both running identical export/deploy process

**Solution**:
- Deleted `.github/workflows/deploy-on-setlist-update.yml` (duplicate)
- Kept `deploy.yml` which handles all event types: `[deploy-setlist, new-concert, manual-deploy, photo-upload, photo-delete]`

**Result**: No more double deployments

---

### 3. ✅ Comprehensive Python Scripts Documentation (COMPLETE)

**Created**:
- `SCRIPTS_DOCUMENTATION.md` (20 KB, 533 lines) - Detailed reference for all 84 scripts
- `SCRIPTS_SUMMARY.txt` (12 KB, 271 lines) - Quick reference guide

**Organization**:
1. **Core/Production Scripts** (10) - Actively maintained
2. **Data Pipeline Scripts** (10) - Initial setup (completed)
3. **Maintenance/Fix Scripts** (26) - As-needed fixes
4. **Testing/Debug Scripts** (18) - Diagnostic tools
5. **Deprecated/Obsolete Scripts** (20) - Can be archived

**Key Scripts to Know**:
- `export_to_web.py` - Export Firestore → JSON (run after any data changes)
- `add_concert.py` - Add new concerts interactively
- `fetch_setlists_enhanced.py` - Fetch setlists with co-headliner support
- `fetch_missing_setlists_with_rotation.py` - Today's new script with API key rotation
- `analyze_setlists.py` - Analyze setlist patterns

### 4. ✅ Fixed Guest Artist Text Color (COMPLETE)

**Problem**: Guest artist info ("with [Artist Name]") displayed in green (#4ade80), hard to read

**Solution**: Changed color to black (#2d1b1b) to match site color scheme

**Files Changed**: `website/js/concert.js` (lines 186, 241)

**Result**: Much easier to read guest artist information under song entries

---

### 5. ✅ Implemented Update Setlist Feature (COMPLETE)

**Feature**: Owner can update/edit setlist.fm URL for concerts that already have setlists

**How It Works**:
1. Owner logs in and visits concert page with existing setlist
2. Clicks "Update Setlist" button (appears next to "View on Setlist.fm")
3. Form appears asking for new setlist.fm URL
4. Script validates URL and fetches fresh data from setlist.fm API
5. Submits to Firestore with `isUpdate: true` flag
6. Cloud Function processes and updates existing setlist
7. GitHub Actions triggers export and deployment
8. Page reloads with updated setlist data

**Files Added/Modified**:
- `website/concert.html` - Added update setlist section HTML
- `website/js/concert.js` - Added Update Setlist button
- `website/js/setlist-submission.js` - Added `initUpdateSetlist()` function

**Visibility**: Button only visible to owner when logged in

---

### 6. ✅ Fixed Duplicate Setlist Issue (COMPLETE)

**Problem**: 60 concerts showing duplicate setlists with "null" artist names
- Example: Concert 1276 showed Dinosaur Jr. (correct), Third Eye Blind with null, then Third Eye Blind (correct) again

**Root Cause**:
- Old single-artist format setlists (document ID = concert_id) coexisting with new multi-artist format (document ID = concert_id-artist-name)
- Old format documents had no `artist_name` field, displayed as "null"

**Solution**:
1. Identified 60 concerts with duplicate setlist documents
2. Deleted all old format setlist documents from Firestore
3. Kept new multi-artist format documents
4. Re-exported data to JSON
5. Deployed updated data

**Affected Concerts**: 60 concerts including:
- 1003, 1013, 1036, 1039, 1054, 1057, 1063, 1080, 1103, 1113, 1134, 1141, 1143, 1163, 1178, 1184, 1185, 1186, 1241, 1252, 1257, 1270, 1271, 1275, 1276
- 605, 620, 624, 628, 645, 676, 677, 695, 697, 707, 708, 714, 724, 737, 759, 764, 768, 769, 770, 780, 791, 794, 797, 799, 801, 831, 847, 849, 850, 859, 860, 896, 917, 924, 944, 977

**Result**: All concerts now display only correct setlists with proper artist names

---

### 7. ✅ Fixed Update Setlist Button Visibility (COMPLETE)

**Problem**: Update Setlist button not appearing on multi-setlist concerts (co-headliners/openers)

**Root Cause**: Button only rendered when `concert.setlistfm_url` existed at top level
- Multi-setlist concerts have URLs in individual setlist objects, not at concert level

**Solution**: Moved button outside conditional check - now appears on ALL concerts with setlists

**Result**: Button now visible on all concerts with setlists when owner is logged in

## Important Notes for Future Development

### Festival Name Usage
**Question**: Should the `festival_name` field be used for benefit concerts?
**Answer**: **YES**

Current usage already includes:
- Actual festivals: "Light of Day Festival"
- Benefit concerts: "Stand Up for Heroes", "12-12-12 Concert For Sandy Relief", "Newtown Benefit"
- Special events: "Candlelight Concerts", "John Henry's Friends"

**Recommendation**: Continue using `festival_name` for benefit concerts as it:
- Provides important context
- Makes concerts searchable by event name
- Is already the established pattern in the database

## Remaining Work / Future Enhancements

### Immediate Next Steps:
1. **Archive deprecated scripts** (~20 scripts) to `scripts/archive/` folder
2. **Test update setlist feature** on a few concerts to verify workflow
3. **Monitor API key usage** - Keys #2 and #3 are still fresh

### Future Setlist Work:
- **288 concerts** still need setlists (22.6% remaining)
- Run fetch script again when API quotas reset (tomorrow)
- Some concerts may not have setlists on setlist.fm (smaller artists, older shows)

### Potential Improvements:
1. **Bulk setlist operations**: Update multiple concerts at once
2. **Setlist validation**: Check for duplicate or incorrect entries
3. **Enhanced search**: Filter concerts by specific songs
4. **Artist statistics**: Most played songs, setlist patterns over time
5. **Tour tracking**: Group concerts by tour names
6. **Photo management**: Bulk upload/delete capabilities

3. **Review pending issues**: Check if there are any failed deployments or errors

### Common Workflows:

#### Adding New Concerts:
```bash
python3 scripts/add_concert.py

python3 scripts/export_to_web.py
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

#### Updating Setlists (Web UI):
1. Log in as owner on website
2. Navigate to concert page with setlist
3. Click "Update Setlist" button
4. Paste new setlist.fm URL
5. Submit (auto-deploys for owner)

#### Data Export (After Firestore Changes):

4. ✅ **Fixed multiple UI/UX issues** - Guest artist color, button visibility
5. ✅ **Cleaned up data** - Removed 60 duplicate setlist documents
6. ✅ **Fixed deployment pipeline** - No more double workflows

**Total setlist coverage**: 987 / 1,275 concerts = **77.4%** 🎉

The website is in excellent shape with robust features for managing and displaying concert data. The remaining 288 concerts without setlists will require either:
- Manual submission via the web form
- Waiting for setlist.fm to get new data
- Running the fetch script again when API quotas reset
