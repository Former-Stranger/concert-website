## 💾 Storage Structure

```
Firebase Storage:
/concert_photos/
  ├── {concert_id}/
  │   ├── {photo_id}.jpg
  │   ├── {photo_id}.png
  │   └── ...

Firestore:
concerts_photos/ (collection)
  ├── {photo_id}/ (document)
  │   ├── concert_id
  │   ├── user_id
  │   ├── download_url
  │   ├── uploaded_at
  │   └── ...
```

## 🚨 Important Notes

1. **Firestore Index**: First photo query will require creating a composite index. Click the link in console error or create manually.

2. **Static Site Updates**: Photos appear immediately via Firestore, but static JSON needs deployment to update:
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```

3. **Owner UID**: The owner UID is hardcoded in:
   - `website/js/auth.js` (line 12)
   - `firestore.rules` (line 12)
   - `storage.rules` (line 11)

   Current: `jBa71VgYp0Qz782bawa4SgjHu1l1`

## 🎨 UI Features

- Responsive 3-column grid (desktop)
- Single column on mobile
- Upload button integrated into header
- Progress bar during upload
- Real-time gallery updates
- Full-screen photo modal
- User attribution (name + profile photo)
- Relative timestamps ("2 hours ago")

## 🔄 Workflow

3. Auto-resizes to max 1920px
4. Uploads to Storage
